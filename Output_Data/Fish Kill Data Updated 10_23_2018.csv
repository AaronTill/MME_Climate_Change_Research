Warden Disher was out of the area but was contacted by a Marvin Woelfel (920-439-1624).  Mr. Woelfel resides at N3439 E Winn Rd., Chilton, WI  53014-9483 and had called Warden Disher to report that there were 2 dozen or so 3 - 4' long fish that looked like little walleye.I tracked down and called Mr. Woelfel and talked to him to get further information.  He said that there were 2 or 3 dozen small fish that looked like walleye washed up on the boat ramp at the end of Quinney Road when he was out walking this morning.  I asked if he saw any that were still swimming around but in distress or almost dead and if there was anything on the water like a slick or sheen or any smell.  He said no, that they looked to have been dead a day or two and were likely washed up by the heavy waves and nothing odd about the water.  I asked him if he recalled seeing any dead before today and he stated that he did see a few ""floaters"" off his dock on Thursday (May 12) but didn't think anything of it.  After talking with Mr. Woelfel, I had fisheries tech Doug Rinzel go to the initial reported site to further investigate and take samples if necessary.  Doug first went to the ramp at Quinney and saw 30 dead fish on 50À of shore at the ramp.  All the fish were adult trout perch.  About a dozen were taken for samples and frozen.  Doug than drove north to Stockbridge harbor to gauge the extent of the die off/kill.  There he observed an estimated 1200 dead fish on roughly 110À of the boat ramp.  In the quieter waters of the harbor he also observed moribund fish.  As at Quinney, the fish were all adult trout perch.  Doug took 30 of the moribund fish for samples.  15 were frozen and 15 were put on ice in the refrigerator over the weekend should Madison want unfrozen samples.  He next  proceeded south to Brothertown harbor.  There he found 100 dead fish on the 50' wide boat ramp.  Again all were adult trout perch.
On his way back to Oshkosh Doug checked Calumet Harbor at Pipe, North Fond du Lac, the wayside on Hwy 45 S, Wendt's and Black Wolf boat landing.  No dead trout perch were seen at any of these sites.
Doug noted that the actual number of dead fish is likely much greater than indicated by the number observed at the 3 locations.  High winds in the previous days, waves in the range of 2.5 - 3 feet, turbid water and the small size of the fish all combined to greatly disperse the dead fish and made them hard to see anywhere except behind sheltered areas.  In addition, the wind and wave action for the last week would disperse most any evidence of a ANTHROPOGENIC CONDITION or point discharge. Looking in Becker's ""Fishes of Wisconsin"" book, this is about the time and temperature that trout perch would start to spawn.  Water temps had been near 60 degrees, but then have dropped about 10 degrees within a short period following a week of unseasonably cold weather, including nights near or below freezing and sleet/snow showers. One of Gordy Priegel's articles is referenced in Becker and in it he notes that ""in Lake Winnebago, adult trout-perch which have just spawned are washed ashore in great numbers; these are erroneously reported by local residents as a large die-off of small walleyes."" Samples of dead and moribund fish were taken should testing for VHS or other cause be desired.  However, it initially appears that we have had a species-specific die-off of trout-perch due to spawning stress compounded by natural environmental stresses.  The strong winds have concentrated and washed up the stressed or dying/dead post-spawn trout-perch onto areas of the east shore between Brothertown and Stockbridge or possibly further north.  More dead fish may continue to appear"

I covered an area of about 150 meters. Only largemouth bass and bluegills were observed. LMB from 8 to 21 inches were found along with bluegills from about 3 to 9 inches. I was surprised at the large size of some of the LMB and bluegills. I contacted Game Warden Dave Oginski from Wausaukee. He reported seeing a bullhead in addition to the LMB and bluegills.

During the past summer an extensive algae bloom (possibly a diatom bloom) began in late July 2006 and lasted about six weeks until September. The lake resident who told me about it did not recall any such bloom in the past 25 years. It did end and the water cleared by early September. 2. On October 23, 2006, a private fish planting of 300 walleyes and 200 crappies took place on Lake Oneonta. When the fish were stocked about 30 walleyes (6-9"") were found dead the next day at the stocking site along with 15 crappies (4-6""). This 10 percent is a releatively high number to die. These dead fish could still be seen with heavy fungus, on the lake botttom, at the stocking site. 3. A fairly heavy snowstorm occurred on November 10, 2006.","Approximately 15 fish including yellow perch, bluegills, black crappies and rock bass were colloected during the investigation. These fish were all either freshly dead or dying. These fish were kept on ice, refrigerated over night and sent down to Madison the next day, November 14, 2006. Sue Marcquenski wanted these fish for bacterial and/or viral testing. If not to determine the cause perhaps some could be ruled out. Greg Sevener was notified of the incident and get his opinion on possible water quality causes. Numerous lake residents were contacted by Justine Hasz and we are still now in contact with them as they were asked to monitor the situatuiion if things change. In the meantime we will wait on the patholgy testing and if that all proves nwegative we will keep close tabs on potential water quality issues in the future. Oneonta lake appears an unlikely candidate for this type of fish kill. It is a very soft water seepage lake of 66 acres with a maximum depth of 25 feet. It has no history of fish kills. Oneonta Lake has on file an MPA of 4 and a conductance of 32. Electrofish sampling would be very difficult.",""

Waterbody of fishing tournament: Green Bay. Weigh-in site: Oconto Breakwater Boat Ramp. Greater than 20 boats estimated.","On 08/14/07 at about 10:30 am Warden Stahl received a call from a male fisherman who seemed very upset about a number of large walleyes that were dead in the area of the Oconto Breakwater Boat Ramp. Subject felt that there were about 25 large walleyes and he was blaming the deaths on the recent walleye fishing tournament that had taken place at Oconto on 08/12/07. Warden Stahl informed the suspect that he would pass the information onto fisheries to investigate. Warden Stahl contacted Peshtigo DNR and found that all fisheries staff was out in the field. Warden Stahl then contacted fish biologist Tammie Paoli and she said she was currently out on the trawler in the southern bay. She asked if Warden Stahl could verify the fish kill and pick up the fish in question. Warden Stahl said that he would look into it. Warden Stahl did respond to Oconto and picked up the Oconto Boat and put in at City Docks. Warden Stahl then motored downstream and did find one large walleye dead against the start of the south break wall. Warden Stahl continued out to the end of the south break wall and then came back along the north break wall. One large walleye was located along the north break wall bayside of the jetty. Warden Stahl found most of the fish (25) in site of the boat landing with 12 large fish on the boat landing apron. Warden Stahl had been in the area the night before and only observed one fish on the apron. The fish were starting to decay but were intact other than some sea gull damage. The fish ranged from 18"" to 31"" with most being well over 20"". Warden Stahl did find one more fish in the turn around basin just upstream from the boat landing. A total of 28 large walleyes were retrieved. No other dead fish were observed other than 2 badly decomposed sheephead. Warden Stahl did take several photos of the fish.  On 8/17/07, Tammie Paoli spoke to a contact (Patrick Schuette) with the Sheboygan Walleye Club to clarify how the tournament was run. He had heard that there were some dead fish but didn't realize to what extent. He said that they did end up sacrificing quite a few fish that didn't look like they had a chance of survival, and only released those fish that they felt looked ""good"". Therefore he was quite surprised to hear that there were 28 dead fish washed up on shore.   We discussed some actions that could have helped prevent the fish kill. The release pontoon boat released the fish just upstream from the boat landing rather than in the bay. This was due to the length of time it took to shuttle fish from the landing back out to the bay, and stronger east winds would not allow the pontoon boat to get out far. He said that water temperatures in the river were similar to the surface temps in the bay, so the event organizers felt that releasing the fish in the river would give them a good chance of survival.   Other actions that his club is considering in future tournaments is a smaller (2 or 3 fish) limit to reduce crowding in livewells, and a stiffer weight penalty for bringing in fish that are dead or nearly dead. Pat will be sending the summary of the tournament (page 2 of the permit application) to Tammie Paoli. This fish kill information was forwarded to Andy Fayram, the contact for WDNR tournaments.",""

He said there were numerous crappie, shiners, and bluegills dead on the south shoreline of the lake.  I was in Albany when the call was received and had plans to meet Deputy Warden Kevin Christorf at the JSC at 11:00 AM.  After we met, we went to Mud Lake.  We found at least 100 crappie in the 11-12.5 inch range, numerous small bluegill, hundreds of shiners, one 15 inch largemouth bass, six perch, and several pumpkinseed dead along the south and southeast shoreline.  The color of the water was green and murky.  We then drove around and checked Clear Lake and another small lake connected to the DNR land to the northwest.  No additional dead fish were observed on these lakes and the water on these lakes did not appear to have as much algae in it.  We drove into the Blackhawk Campground and talked with someone fishing on Clear Lake.  The fisherman was catching healthy looking fish and did not see any dead ones.  We then drove to an access point to Mud Lake and talked with three fishermen that reported catching healthy bullheads, but noticed numerous dead crappies on the shoreline.  I noted there were numerous live turtles and frogs in and on the pond as well as seagulls and blue herons feeding on the dead fish. On August 12th, I called and left Bob Swan a voice mail message with a report of the D.O. level found on Mud Lake and said the likely cause of the fish kill was the fluctuation of the oxygen level after the rainfall last week.

I talked with Greg Rublee about options for lake aeration at Bucks Lake, assuming that no electrical power is available nearby.  In our opinion, solar-powered systems are expensive ($8,000 to $10,000 for materials alone).  They have high maintenance needs (must remove snow from solar panels each time it snows).  Operation relies on sunlight (often scarce in winter) and battery storage.  Batteries have a limited lifetime and replacement and disposal are expensive.  Solar power aerators can only run small blowers so the open-water holes are pretty small too (maybe 20 x 20 feet), and the holes freeze again when the blowers stop.  Another lower-cost option that you might want to consider is a wind-powered aerator.  They don't rely on electricity, but instead they circulate water with a submerged propeller directly attached by a shaft to the wind vanes.  The units are installed on floats before ice-up and secured with lines to anchors on the lakebed.  The vanes are locked in place until ice is thick enough to put up a barricade.  Once the vanes are released, a hole opens pretty quickly.  Our Department has several wind aerators operating on lakes within the Chequamegon National Forest, including a heavy duty one (cost ~$4000, requires 5 mph wind speed) manufactured by LAS International at Lake Three in Ashland County west of Mellen, WI.  WDNR also has a much lighter and nicer one at Twin Lake in the far NE corner of Price County.  That unit was distributed by Keeton Industries www.keetonaquatics.com and sold for about $1200.  This one operated at lower wind speeds of 1 or 2 mph.  The last time we checked it was no longer in production, but Greg remembers them saying that if the demand was there, they might build more.  Greg will send you some photos by e-mail.  Wind-powered aerators also have some of the same limitations as solar aerator systems--small hole, dependent on wind, hole skims over, but usually opens again quickly.  But for the cost of one solar aerator, you could install several wind aerators, and their routine maintenance needs are far less too.
The log fetch and east-west orientation of Bucks Lake should be suitable to take advantage of prevailing west winds.  The location should be in the upstream third of the flowage, not down near the outlet.  Since the units are anchored to the lakebed, a permit would be necessary from Jon Kleist in our Water Regs and Zoning Section.  Another consideration is that winterkill of fish from oxygen depletion may not be a chronic problem at Bucks Lake.  I realize that there's interest in lake aeration now that we suspect a winterkill has occurred this season.  But as Paul suggested, that possible loss may be the result of greater biological oxygen demand from decomposing plant material from the wetlands that became flooded when the reservoir elevation increased last fall with the dam renovations.  It's hard to predict how often a similar event might happen in the future, but it also might be premature to take heroic measures right away.",""
