A large sample of fresh dead and moribund fish were tested for VHSv and initial PCR results were negative for it.  No columnaris was detected, but several ubiquitous bacteria were isolated from the kidney, which when fish are stressed can infect the fish and cause mortality.  The stress might have been spawning, but Sue commented that the gills were pale and had hyperplasia (extra cell growth).  Her comment was that if these had been hatchery fish she would have guessed they were on their way toward bacterial gill disease.  She collected tissues for histopathology and has asked the lab to prepare slides.  The time of year/water temps are right about when trout perch spawn.  Water temps had been near 60 degrees, but then have dropped about 10 degrees within a short period following a week of unseasonably cold weather, including nights near or below freezing and sleet/snow showers.  One of Gordy Priegel's articles is referenced in Becker and in it he notes that ""in Lake Winnebago, adult trout-perch which have just spawned are washed ashore in great numbers; these are erroneously reported by local residents as a large die-off of small walleyes.""

Mr. Woelfel resides at N3439 E Winn Rd., Chilton, WI  53014-9483 and had called Warden Disher to report that there were 2 dozen or so 3 - 4' long fish that looked like little walleye.I tracked down and called Mr. Woelfel and talked to him to get further information.  He said that there were 2 or 3 dozen small fish that looked like walleye washed up on the boat ramp at the end of Quinney Road when he was out walking this morning.  I asked if he saw any that were still swimming around but in distress or almost dead and if there was anything on the water like a slick or sheen or any smell.  He said no, that they looked to have been dead a day or two and were likely washed up by the heavy waves and nothing odd about the water.  I asked him if he recalled seeing any dead before today and he stated that he did see a few ""floaters"" off his dock on Thursday (May 12) but didn't think anything of it.  After talking with Mr. Woelfel, I had fisheries tech Doug Rinzel go to the initial reported site to further investigate and take samples if necessary.  Doug first went to the ramp at Quinney and saw 30 dead fish on 50À of shore at the ramp.  All the fish were adult trout perch.  About a dozen were taken for samples and frozen.  Doug than drove north to Stockbridge harbor to gauge the extent of the die off/kill.  There he observed an estimated 1200 dead fish on roughly 110À of the boat ramp.  In the quieter waters of the harbor he also observed moribund fish.  As at Quinney, the fish were all adult trout perch.  Doug took 30 of the moribund fish for samples.  15 were frozen and 15 were put on ice in the refrigerator over the weekend should Madison want unfrozen samples.  He next  proceeded south to Brothertown harbor.  There he found 100 dead fish on the 50' wide boat ramp.  Again all were adult trout perch.
On his way back to Oshkosh Doug checked Calumet Harbor at Pipe, North Fond du Lac, the wayside on Hwy 45 S, Wendt's and Black Wolf boat landing.  No dead trout perch were seen at any of these sites.
Doug noted that the actual number of dead fish is likely much greater than indicated by the number observed at the 3 locations.  High winds in the previous days, waves in the range of 2.5 - 3 feet, turbid water and the small size of the fish all combined to greatly disperse the dead fish and made them hard to see anywhere except behind sheltered areas.  In addition, the wind and wave action for the last week would disperse most any evidence of a ANTHROPOGENIC CONDITION or point discharge. Looking in Becker's ""Fishes of Wisconsin"" book, this is about the time and temperature that trout perch would start to spawn.  Water temps had been near 60 degrees, but then have dropped about 10 degrees within a short period following a week of unseasonably cold weather, including nights near or below freezing and sleet/snow showers. One of Gordy Priegel's articles is referenced in Becker and in it he notes that ""in Lake Winnebago, adult trout-perch which have just spawned are washed ashore in great numbers; these are erroneously reported by local residents as a large die-off of small walleyes."" Samples of dead and moribund fish were taken should testing for VHS or other cause be desired.  However, it initially appears that we have had a species-specific die-off of trout-perch due to spawning stress compounded by natural environmental stresses.  The strong winds have concentrated and washed up the stressed or dying/dead post-spawn trout-perch onto areas of the east shore between Brothertown and Stockbridge or possibly further north.  More dead fish may continue to appear"

I contacted Fisheries Biologist, Hogler and Water Quality Biologist, Gansberg both were unaware of a complaint. I traveled to the Kewaunee River on May 21, 2012.  I investigated Cyde Hill Road bridge crossing and obtained access to the Cedar Valley Campground. I did note that dead Crayfish were present. I observed one dead Johnny Darter and a single 9-10 inch brown trout.  I observed living bivalves, small crayfish, numerous stocked rainbow and brown trout (bridge) as well as spawning dace, creek chub and minnow fry at the campground. It was unclear to me if an event occurred. The water appeared cloudy but without sheen normal for the Kewaunee River. The owner of the campground indicated that a flood event did occur ~ two weeks ago. Other, parameters (Temp, DO saturation) were not collected due to a defect with my meter.

Upon investigation, numerous fish were observed dead on the bottom while others were ""porpoising"".  The water was very dark and foamy.  Residents stated that the creek smelled earlier in the day.  Vetrano investigated further upstream throughout the watershed but could not find an obvious source.  Water appeared to become clearer further upstream.  Sunday 9/23/2007 54 brown trout found dead at Bangor Park, 41 dead (7-18"") at Russian Coulee Road, 10 dead (6-10"") at Schroeder Road, 4 dead (7-11"") at Darling Road, 11 dead (5-15"") at Coleman Road, and 32 dead brown trout (4-16"") and 1 brook stickleback below the hwy 162 bridge.  Monday 9/24/2007 Fish crew shocked a station at Coleman Road (100m) and found 28 dead brown trout and 9 live trout.  Live trout seemed to be stressed.  There was no evidence that other fish or invertebrate species were affected.  Since, we have found that the kill was originated from a point source in Monroe County (manure-from a facility with 600 head and no storage).  A total of 225 fish were observed dead by fisheries personnel-however we believe that at least 50% of the population died as a result to the manure.

Surendonk contacted Donofrio via phone and was advised that Warden Michael Kuhn (Brown County) had responded to a fish kill complain on a unnamed tributary to the Devils River over the weekend. He was requesting support from Department staff for the investigation.  Donofrio stated that the event was documented near the city of Denmark in the stream corridor adjacent to the BelGioioso Cheese Inc. facility on the corner of Highway 96 and Highway NN in Brown County, Wisconsin and at further downstream locations (Figure 1). -  Surendonk contacted Rodney Lange, Fisheries Technician via phone to coordinate a field investigation.  Surendonk requested that Lange bring with him the DepartmentÀs YSI 85 Water Quality Meter and both agreed to meet at the stream crossing on Highway NN at 9:00 am.  -  Surendonk arrived at the Highway NN stream crossing and found that Lange was parked across the street from the BelGioioso Cheese Plant on Hwy NN. Lange was having a conversation with an individual who identified himself as the President of BelGioioso Cheese Incorporated. Surendonk introduced himself as Wisconsin DNR and that he was conducting an investigational response to a reported fish kill in the unnamed tributary. -  The BelGioioso Cheese Inc. President stated he became aware this morning that Department staff had contacted BelGioioso staff over the weekend regarding the fish kill. The individual produced a business card and provided it to Lange. After a short conversation with the BelGioioso representative Surendonk asked permission to enter onto BelGioioso Cheese Inc. property.  This individual responded that we could enter the property and the representative accompanied Lange and Surendonk onto the property (Figure 2).  -  Lange, Surendonk and the BelGioioso representative discussed the unnamed stream at the Highway NN crossing. Surendonk observed that the water was cloudy (white/silver) with a white greasy substance (likely bacteria) covering the channel substrate. Surendonk provided the BelGioioso representative with a sample of the white greasy substance. The BelGioioso representative state if they would have released product it would look different for what Surendonk provided, the BelGioioso representative suggested that we look else were for the source of the event. The BelGioioso representative state that they have ""enemies"" in the area. - Surendonk stated that the investigation was ""just starting"".  Surendonk noted a single brook stickleback struggling and tumbling down the channel at this location. Surendonk and Lange measured water quality at Highway NN and found it to contain 1.48 mg/L dissolved oxygen (Table 1). The BelGioioso representative asked what that meant. Surendonk stated that the state standard is 5.00 mg/L dissolved oxygen.  -  Surendonk, Lange and the BelGioioso representative inspected the area near the waste lagoon pit and high content underground holding tanks (HCHT). Surendonk found the area to be unremarkable with the exception of the HCHT that was found to be uncapped (the cement cap was laying in the tall grass and forbs adjacent to the access port). Surendonk did note a small volume of fluid (one square foot) that appeared to coat the upland vegetation between the lagoon and the tributary stream. Surendonk showed the BelGioioso representative the coated vegetation.   The BelGioioso representative stated that one of the ""fine"" neighbors must have dumped it. -  The BelGioioso representative asked how they could control the ""tall grass"". Surendonk identified the grass as Phragmites and stated he was unsure, but believed that the plant could be controlled b",,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,0,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,0,,,

The reports indicated that a large number of fish were dead and dying. I along with Tammie Paoli  drove up to Oneonta Lake to investigate. We checked at the access site which is walk in or canoe only down a steep bank. Indeed many, many fish were dead and dying. In an area right in front of the access site about 50' by 25', I counted dead approximately 50 yellow perch, all yoy or yearling size, 6 adult bluegills, 3 Iowa darters, 1 adult rock bass and 1 adult walleye. We then went to one of the lake residents Carl Rodgers, who lives on the east siore of the lake, Lot 25. In front of his dock a similar array of dead fish could be seen, both in number and species. The measurements from the dead fish included in this report came from this site. He then took us in his boat around a short portion of the shore and the picture was the same all over. Dead fish coulsd also be found around the island in the lake. We did not traverse the entire shoreline but dead fish could be found wherever we looked. In the areas I covered I noticed approximately 30 dead adult walleyes. Some live fish could be seen swimming although they had a reduced fright behavior. Time did not allow a complete navigation of the lake shoreline but the kill was very extensive and covered all areas of the shoreline that I saw. Carl Rodgers gave me what I felt was a very accurate timetable of the kill. The y startyed seeing a few fish dying on Friday, November 10, 2006 with increasinmg numbers on Saturday and Sunday. Only limited signs of decopmposition was observed and most of the fish had no visinble appearances that could be tied into the mortality. A few of the crappies had slight hemoraging at the base of the pectoral fins. Fish of all sizes and many different species were observed. Interstingly no northern pike were found dead although they are in the lake. Small yellow perch were the most commonly observed dead fish along the shoreline. As of today, Thursday, November 16, 2006, a few fish are still dying and larger lasrgemouth bass can be seen in the shalow water still showing lethargic behavior. The bass may be the least affect species in regard to actual mortality.",Large Number,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,213.2,"During the course of the investigation three events surfaced that may or may nor have a bearing on this situation. 1. During the past summer an extensive algae bloom (possibly a diatom bloom) began in late July 2006 and lasted about six weeks until September. The lake resident who told me about it did not recall any such bloom in the past 25 years. It did end and the water cleared by early September. 2. On October 23, 2006, a private fish planting of 300 walleyes and 200 crappies took place on Lake Oneonta. When the fish were stocked about 30 walleyes (6-9"") were found dead the next day at the stocking site along with 15 crappies (4-6""). This 10 percent is a releatively high number to die. These dead fish could still be seen with heavy fungus, on the lake botttom, at the stocking site. 3. A fairly heavy snowstorm occurred on November 10, 2006.","Approximately 15 fish including yellow perch, bluegills, black crappies and rock bass were colloected during the investigation. These fish were all either freshly dead or dying. These fish were kept on ice, refrigerated over night and sent down to Madison the next day, November 14, 2006. Sue Marcquenski wanted these fish for bacterial and/or viral testing. If not to determine the cause perhaps some could be ruled out. Greg Sevener was notified of the incident and get his opinion on possible water quality causes. Numerous lake residents were contacted by Justine Hasz and we are still now in contact with them as they were asked to monitor the situatuiion if things change. In the meantime we will wait on the patholgy testing and if that all proves nwegative we will keep close tabs on potential water quality issues in the future. Oneonta lake appears an unlikely candidate for this type of fish kill. It is a very soft water seepage lake of 66 acres with a maximum depth of 25 feet. It has no history of fish kills. Oneonta Lake has on file an MPA of 4 and a conductance of 32. Electrofish sampling would be very difficult.",

Reported by Mr. Grenier. Following is a summary of my investigation:  I spoke to Mr. Grenier on Thursday morning during my field investigation. According to Mr. Grenier he routinely walks his dog along the same stretch of Oak Creek Parkway every evening, generally between 7 PM and 8 PM, and makes a point to observe the stream. On the evening of Wed., August 15th 1-day prior to his observed fish kill, Mr. Grenier reported nothing unusual; no dead fish, no discoloration, surface material or odors, etc. On the evening of August 16th, he observed between 100 and 200 dead fish from a top of the 16th and Rawson Ave. bridge. He did not observe any discolored water, surface sheens, or odors. He did not recall seeing any stressed or live fish.  On Thursday, August 16, 2012 at 0830 I arrived at the site of the reported fish kill and observed approximately 50 dead fish entangled in overhanging bank vegetation and in other in-stream debris along an ~100-ft reach upstream of 16th Ave. In response to heavy rains that began around 0630 and continued during my investigation, the stream was very turbid with transparency less than a few inches. According to the continuous USGS gage located ~1-mile downstream, Oak Creek flow rose from a base flow of just 3.5 cfs at 0700, to 32 cfs at 0715, to 62 cfs at 0720. A typical response for urbanized watersheds without stormwater abatement.  I proceeded upstream to an additional 4 road xings and 3 park trail access points up to Marshall Ave. extended. I observed a decreasing number of dead fish up to Marshall Avenue extended where I did not observe any dead fish. I canÀt say for certain that this was the furthest upstream extent of the fish kill or source of killing agent as the high stream flows could have removed dead fish from upstream reaches. I did not observe any stressed or live fish due to the high turbidity, dead or stressed invertebrates, or other wildlife at any of the sites. I estimated 200-300 dead fish in the ~500-ft of stream that I walked. ~80% were White suckers of various year classes 3-12 inches; ~15% Creek chubs also of multiple year classes; and <5% as Green sunfish, Central mudminnow, and a single Black bullhead. None of the inspected fish displayed any obvious deformities, eroded fins, lesions, tumors (DELTs), or parasites. This suggests that the killing agent was not selective among fish species or age-class.  I met with Lieut. Peter Jaske (414) 768-8060 of the South Milwaukee police department and summarized what I observed. He was not aware of the incident and would be contacting other officers and city department heads to get their feedback, and let me know if anything comes of his inquiry. I also contacted Chris Magruder of the Milw. Metro. Sew. District (MMSD) and requested information on precipitation amounts leading up to the fish kill, specifically the 0.8 cfs ÀbumpÀ in the stream flow observed on Wed., Aug. 15th around 1330 (see stream gage plot below). This bump may be associated with a minor and brief precipitation and ANTHROPOGENIC CONDITION event, or a point source discharge. A brief malfunction in the gage cannot be discounted. The MMSD routinely collects physical, chemical and biological water quality data at numerous streams and sites as part of their monitoring program, and according to Chris the field crews sampled Oak Creek on Wed. August 15th.  Instantaneous water quality measures using multi-probe sonde, laboratory analysis for conventional pollutants (i.e., nutrients, solids, BOD, etc.) and select heavy metals did not reveal any obvious killing agent or surrogate parameter that may have suggested impacted water quality (i.e., conductivity or turbidity spike).",Large Number,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,201,Road constructioon ~ 2 miles upstream of impacted reach,Complete synoptic field assessment for fish and macroinvertebrates,"I did not observe any stressed or live fish due to the high turbidity, dead or stressed invertebrates, or other wildlife at any of the sites. I estimated 200-300 dead fish in the ~500-ft of stream that I walked. ~80% were White suckers of various year classes 3-12 inches; ~15% Creek chubs also of multiple year classes; and <5% as Green sunfish, Central mudminnow, and a single Black bullhead. None of the inspected fish displayed any obvious deformities, eroded fins, lesions, tumors (DELTs), or parasites. This suggests that the killing agent was not selective among fish species or age-class."

Subject felt that there were about 25 large walleyes and he was blaming the deaths on the recent walleye fishing tournament that had taken place at Oconto on 08/12/07. Warden Stahl informed the suspect that he would pass the information onto fisheries to investigate. Warden Stahl contacted Peshtigo DNR and found that all fisheries staff was out in the field. Warden Stahl then contacted fish biologist Tammie Paoli and she said she was currently out on the trawler in the southern bay. She asked if Warden Stahl could verify the fish kill and pick up the fish in question. Warden Stahl said that he would look into it. Warden Stahl did respond to Oconto and picked up the Oconto Boat and put in at City Docks. Warden Stahl then motored downstream and did find one large walleye dead against the start of the south break wall. Warden Stahl continued out to the end of the south break wall and then came back along the north break wall. One large walleye was located along the north break wall bayside of the jetty. Warden Stahl found most of the fish (25) in site of the boat landing with 12 large fish on the boat landing apron. Warden Stahl had been in the area the night before and only observed one fish on the apron. The fish were starting to decay but were intact other than some sea gull damage. The fish ranged from 18"" to 31"" with most being well over 20"". Warden Stahl did find one more fish in the turn around basin just upstream from the boat landing. A total of 28 large walleyes were retrieved. No other dead fish were observed other than 2 badly decomposed sheephead. Warden Stahl did take several photos of the fish.  On 8/17/07, Tammie Paoli spoke to a contact (Patrick Schuette) with the Sheboygan Walleye Club to clarify how the tournament was run. He had heard that there were some dead fish but didn't realize to what extent. He said that they did end up sacrificing quite a few fish that didn't look like they had a chance of survival, and only released those fish that they felt looked ""good"". Therefore he was quite surprised to hear that there were 28 dead fish washed up on shore.   We discussed some actions that could have helped prevent the fish kill. The release pontoon boat released the fish just upstream from the boat landing rather than in the bay. This was due to the length of time it took to shuttle fish from the landing back out to the bay, and stronger east winds would not allow the pontoon boat to get out far. He said that water temperatures in the river were similar to the surface temps in the bay, so the event organizers felt that releasing the fish in the river would give them a good chance of survival.   Other actions that his club is considering in future tournaments is a smaller (2 or 3 fish) limit to reduce crowding in livewells, and a stiffer weight penalty for bringing in fish that are dead or nearly dead. Pat will be sending the summary of the tournament (page 2 of the permit application) to Tammie Paoli. This fish kill information was forwarded to Andy Fayram, the contact for WDNR tournaments.",

I was in Albany when the call was received and had plans to meet Deputy Warden Kevin Christorf at the JSC at 11:00 AM.  After we met, we went to Mud Lake.  We found at least 100 crappie in the 11-12.5 inch range, numerous small bluegill, hundreds of shiners, one 15 inch largemouth bass, six perch, and several pumpkinseed dead along the south and southeast shoreline.  The color of the water was green and murky.  We then drove around and checked Clear Lake and another small lake connected to the DNR land to the northwest.  No additional dead fish were observed on these lakes and the water on these lakes did not appear to have as much algae in it.  We drove into the Blackhawk Campground and talked with someone fishing on Clear Lake.  The fisherman was catching healthy looking fish and did not see any dead ones.  We then drove to an access point to Mud Lake and talked with three fishermen that reported catching healthy bullheads, but noticed numerous dead crappies on the shoreline.  I noted there were numerous live turtles and frogs in and on the pond as well as seagulls and blue herons feeding on the dead fish. On August 12th, I called and left Bob Swan a voice mail message with a report of the D.O. level found on Mud Lake and said the likely cause of the fish kill was the fluctuation of the oxygen level after the rainfall last week.

The very low dissolved oxygen concentrations from surface to bottom at this early point in winter along with the sulfur odor that you and Gavin noticed both indicate to me that there is strong likelihood that a winterkill of fish has already occurred in Bucks Lake this year.  Your suggestion about the possible cause of oxygen depletion is plausible.  Decomposition of the wetland vegetation recently flooded with the 1_ feet added to the dam in the 2007 renovation could increase the biological demand for oxygen beneath the ice.  The slight increase in oxygen concentration near the bottom is probably really hydrogen sulfide and not dissolved oxygen.  The temperature readings greater than 4¡ C  near the bottom probably reflect heat generated from anaerobic decomposition.  In my opinion, at this point emergency lake aeration to avoid a fishkill would not be worthwhile, and it could be counterproductive.  Circulating hydrogen sulfide throughout the water column may increase the chemical oxygen demand to consume the remaining oxygen where fish and other aquatic life might find refuge.  It's impossible to predict the severity of the winterkill from oxygen readings, but I would expect a behavioral response from several adaptive species that might find better conditions upstream in Hemlock Creek.  We'll try to visit Bucks Lake shortly after ice-out this spring to see if there's any evidence of a fishkill, and if so, to gauge the extent of losses.  Fortunately, as you observed after the last winterkill on Bucks Lake about 15 years ago, we should again expect a fast recovery for the fish community in this highly productive system.",UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,0,UNKNOWN,UNKNOWN,66.6,Dam renovations completed in fall 2007 increased reservoir elevation by about 1.5 feet and flooded wetland vegetation that's decomposing under the ice and consuming oxygen.,"Rusk County asked for information to investigate options for lake aeration and I provided the following to Gary Albrecht.    I talked with Greg Rublee about options for lake aeration at Bucks Lake, assuming that no electrical power is available nearby.  In our opinion, solar-powered systems are expensive ($8,000 to $10,000 for materials alone).  They have high maintenance needs (must remove snow from solar panels each time it snows).  Operation relies on sunlight (often scarce in winter) and battery storage.  Batteries have a limited lifetime and replacement and disposal are expensive.  Solar power aerators can only run small blowers so the open-water holes are pretty small too (maybe 20 x 20 feet), and the holes freeze again when the blowers stop.  Another lower-cost option that you might want to consider is a wind-powered aerator.  They don't rely on electricity, but instead they circulate water with a submerged propeller directly attached by a shaft to the wind vanes.  The units are installed on floats before ice-up and secured with lines to anchors on the lakebed.  The vanes are locked in place until ice is thick enough to put up a barricade.  Once the vanes are released, a hole opens pretty quickly.  Our Department has several wind aerators operating on lakes within the Chequamegon National Forest, including a heavy duty one (cost ~$4000, requires 5 mph wind speed) manufactured by LAS International at Lake Three in Ashland County west of Mellen, WI.  WDNR also has a much lighter and nicer one at Twin Lake in the far NE corner of Price County.  That unit was distributed by Keeton Industries www.keetonaquatics.com and sold for about $1200.  This one operated at lower wind speeds of 1 or 2 mph.  The last time we checked it was no longer in production, but Greg remembers them saying that if the demand was there, they might build more.  Greg will send you some photos by e-mail.  Wind-powered aerators also have some of the same limitations as solar aerator systems--small hole, dependent on wind, hole skims over, but usually opens again quickly.  But for the cost of one solar aerator, you could install several wind aerators, and their routine maintenance needs are far less too.
The log fetch and east-west orientation of Bucks Lake should be suitable to take advantage of prevailing west winds.  The location should be in the upstream third of the flowage, not down near the outlet.  Since the units are anchored to the lakebed, a permit would be necessary from Jon Kleist in our Water Regs and Zoning Section.  Another consideration is that winterkill of fish from oxygen depletion may not be a chronic problem at Bucks Lake.  I realize that there's interest in lake aeration now that we suspect a winterkill has occurred this season.  But as Paul suggested, that possible loss may be the result of greater biological oxygen demand from decomposing plant material from the wetlands that became flooded when the reservoir elevation increased last fall with the dam renovations.  It's hard to predict how often a similar event might happen in the future, but it also might be premature to take heroic measures right away.",

All DO measurement were below 0.8 mg/L in Long Lake and specific conductivity averaged 123 µS/cm. The mean temperature was 24.7 ¼C. Dissolved oxygen was 5.6 mg/L in a secondary channel of the Mississippi River immediately upstream of the outlet of Long Lake. In the Black River, near the Hwy. 35 bridge (station 8), DO was 5.4 mg/L. Duckweed covered nearly 100% of the NW side of the lake extending for a length of about 250m. Duckweed covered less than 50% of the remainder of the lake.  Flow patterns were visually estimated. Water entered the eastern entrance to the lake from Mud Lake (Big Marsh) and exited through Webb Slough to the south, and the outlet structure on the west into a secondary channel. Current velocities were substantial at the inflow station, and near both outflow station, and I attributed this to a recent extreme raise in the elevation of the Black River.  Based on these observations, its likely fish died from low dissolved oxygen attributable to high oxygen demand from water originating from Mud Lake.

The 7% estimated mortality of 607 fish is a maximum estimate as very few fish were observed throughout the majority of the lake, and dead northern pike were mainly observed at the south end or leeward side of the lake with recent north winds.  I would expect the 7% would not be additive to the total average annual mortality rate and most likely be insignificant when considering the added protection from angler harvest via the new restrictive 40 inch minimum length limit.  No fresh mortalities were observed, and no fish were collected for in depth fish health examination.  Early reports of stress were reported by anglers as northern had redness and irritation on the skin. The cause of the fish kill is likely due to a combination of factors including the following;Lower water levels resulting in lower carrying capacity of the lake's predator density.  Lower water levels causing higher average water temperatures in the high 80's and even in low 90's as reported by anglers.  High angling pressure combined with high water temperatures causing increased hooking mortality from catch and release.  The majority of the lake is looking good with a diversity of macrophytes covering the lake and water clarity is getting better.

Riparian land use is primarily wetlands followed by agriculture and some dwellings in upland areas.,Many panfish and bass were observed with no health concerns.  The only northern pike observed were already a day or two post mortem.  Angler reports have been good despite hot weather indicating an overall healthy fishery.,SELECTIVE,DIRECT TEMPERATURE STRESS,SUMMERKILL,SUMMERKILL,Jul,SUMMERKILL,"Sue Marquenski noted on July 9,2012:  Extremely hot weather resulting in sustained high water temps could be the ultimate cause of death; also in combination with stress associated bacterial infections such as Aeromonas hydrophila, and if algae are dying, low DO and possible algal toxin release.  If algae are not dying, O2 supersaturation could also be a factor.  I checked BeckerÀs Fishes of WI and experimentally, n pike have been acclimated to temps as high as 89.6-95.5 ; Eaton et al. 1995  (attached) determined that the max temp for n pike is 83-86 F if sustained for a week.  About 5-10 (?) years ago we had reports of n pike dying in the Yahara River during another heat wave, so they do not tolerate extreme temps and if a cooler refugium is not available, they can die just from physiological changes caused by extreme temps (critical cellular reactions just do not happen at certain temps for certain species of fish).  If a fish has been trying to cope with extreme temps for several days, changes occur in the kidney that we can see histologically if the fish is either alive (weak, moribund) at collection, euthanized, bagged and put on ice and necropsied within 12 hours.  If fish in this condition are not available, we cannot tell by exam if the cause of death was temperature related.  We can still examine moribund  fish or freshly dead fish if the gills are at least pink to red, for pathogens.

Sustained high water temperatures are definitely the major cause.   Angling pressure is always high on this waterbody, and catch and release may be a contributing factor.   A similar fish kill was observed during low water periods last year at this time.  "
